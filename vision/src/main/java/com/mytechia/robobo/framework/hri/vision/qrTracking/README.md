# Robobo QR detection module


The module provides the following data about the detected objects:

- x: x coordinate.
- y: x coordinate.
- distance: Approximated distance of the QRCode.
- p1: ‘x’ and ‘y’ coordinates of the first point of interest (Result point).
- p2: ‘x’ and ‘y’ coordinates of the second point of interest (Result point).
- p3:  ‘x’ and ‘y’ coordinates of the third point of interest (Result point).
- id: QRCode identifier.
